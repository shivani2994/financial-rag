# Financial RAG

An analyst-primary Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over financial
documents. A research analyst asks a plain-language question and gets a
grounded, cited answer drawn only from the source documents — with an honest
refusal when supporting context is weak.

Corpus: SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), earnings-call transcripts, and synthetic
investment memos, for three peer companies (KO, PEP, MDLZ) across two
quarters.

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the full project spec, architecture, and
build plan. This project is being built module by module, in order; install
and usage instructions will grow here as each module lands.

## Status

**Phase 1, Module 2 (ingestion)** — complete.

## Install

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust any values you want to override
(all settings have working defaults):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running

### Ingestion

Source PDFs live under `data/<TICKER>/`, named `<TICKER>_<DOCTYPE>_<PERIOD>.pdf`
(e.g. `KO_10-K_FY2025.pdf`, `KO_transcript_2026Q1.pdf`). Run ingestion with:

```bash
uv run python -m src.ingestion.pipeline
```

This reads every PDF under `data/`, tags each chunk with metadata parsed from
its filename, splits filings by item and transcripts by speaker turn, and
writes the full chunk list to `data/processed/chunks.jsonl` (JSON Lines, one
chunk per line), overwriting it each run. Re-running is safe — it always
rebuilds from scratch, so it never duplicates chunks.

Indexing, retrieval, generation, serving, and evaluation instructions will be
added here as their modules are built.
